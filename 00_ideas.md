## Project Ideas

### Writing a stand-alone project admin backend
Open Humans is a modular eco system in which users can start their own projects
that can request data from users or put new data into the accounts of users.
These interactions are done largely through APIs. But for many basic administrative
works a graphical user interface would be good to have. Such a GUI
should be a stand-alone Django application that interfaces with the existing
Open Humans API methods. You can find
[more details in the corresponding GitHub issue](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/issues/690).

This project requires rudimentary skills in web application design and ideally some familiarity with Django/Python.
Students will learn how to interface with APIs and how build modular web applications.  


**Feel free to propose your own entirely new idea.**
