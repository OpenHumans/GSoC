## Contributing: General tips

All our projects involve working with open source web apps &ndash; probably
Django, and running on Heroku. (This is what our team has the most expertise
in!) We have templates and example Django projects to help you get started.

**Django tutorial:** If you're new to Django, we recommend you do the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/) first, to
get a feel for Django project development.

**Python development with pipenv:** [Pipenv](http://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
is now the officially recommended packaging tool for Python development. We
recommend you install and use this, and we're working on transitioning our own
projects to this.

Pipenv will help you create and manage virtual environments that provide the
package dependencies of a project. When developing on your own machine, you
should be installing dependencies for a particular project within a virtual
environment â€“ not globally.

If you develop against a project that has a `requirements.txt` but no `Pipfile` yet
you can use `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` to generate the `Pipfile` and install
the dependencies.

**Making Pull Requests**
Some general tips for making Pull Requests to our repositories:
- Pull requests should target only a single issue/feature. Don't put too many changes into a single pull request
- Reference open issues that your pull request targets and tries to solve
- Make sure to not accidentally change lots of unrelated files, e.g. don't commit temporary files from your editor, style changes introduced by your editor or unneeded file permission changes.
- Pull requests that you think are ready to be merged should be prefixed with `MRG: `, e.g. the title should be `MRG: new feature X, closes #2`
- Furthermore, you can already open pull requests and work on them if you want to get feedback during the development phase. The name of those *work in progress* pull requests should be prefixed with `WIP: `, e.g. `WIP: new feature X`

## Project Ideas

**Note:** We have proposed both "data source" and "data exploration" projects. These
are not exclusive categories! One project could propose to both add *and*
analyze data! (If you'd like inspiration, check out the
[Twitter Archive Analyzer](http://www.twarxiv.org), which adds Twitter archive
data to Open Humans *and* analyzes it.)

-----

### Add new data sources
Members of *Open Humans* can [connect data and upload data from external resources](https://www.openhumans.org/add-data/)
into their accounts to share this data with other projects, research studies and individuals. Many of these
data imports are community curated. We are looking for students who are interested in contributing
new data sources. Write a data importer for your favorite sleep tracking, diet logging or
social media application.

Some data import ideas we had so far:
* RescueTime
* Google location history through Google Takeout
* Personal Facebook feed
* your personal idea!

These projects require rudimentary skills in web application design to connect to *Open Humans*.
Students will learn how to interface with the APIs of their data source as well as the Open Humans API. Additionally
students will become more familiar with building decentralized applications. This project can be mentored by [Mike](https://github.com/mcescalante)
[Mad](https://github.com/madprime) and/or [Bastian](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke).

#### Contributing

Outreachy requires applicants to demonstrate skill and interest by making
one or more contributions to the project they're interested in.

To do so for this project, we ask you to try doing one or more of the following:

* Get one or both of these template "data source" projects running.
    * [oh_data_uploader](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/oh_data_uploader)<br>
    Deposits a file uploaded by the user to their Open Humans account. Intended for simple
    addition of files as sources, designed to be easy to get working with minimal technical understanding of the underlying web app.
    * [oh-data-source-template](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-source-template)<br>
     Deposits a "lorem ipsum" text file to the user's Open Humans account. Intended to be a starter for a full data source integration, using celery for asynchronous processing
     (e.g. to run jobs that collate data from APIs).
* Share some code relevant to the data source your interested in adding (e.g. an example of pulling data the relevant API, or an example of scrubbing sensitive data from an uploaded file)
* Modify one of the template projects to improve it for other users.
* Modify one of the template projects to add some of the data source you're interested in.

-----

### Add Data Exploration projects
Members of *Open Humans* can use the different data sets they have connected to their account in various
data exploration tools. We are looking for students who are interested in contributing
new data exploration tools that access a member's data sets to generate interesting insights.
These can be in form of data visualization/analysis or generating derived new data sets.

Some data explorations ideas we had so far:
* Genetic ancestry interpretation
* Use time stamped GPS data & step counts to analyse how weather influences activity
* your personal idea!

These projects require rudimentary skills in web application design to connect to *Open Humans*.
Students will learn how to interface with the APIs of Open Humans. Additionally
students will become more familiar with building decentralized applications. This project can be mentored by [Mike](https://github.com/mcescalante)
[Mad](https://github.com/madprime) and/or [Bastian](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke).

#### Contributing

Outreachy requires applicants to demonstrate skill and interest by making
one or more contributions to the project they're interested in.

To do so for this project, we ask you to try doing some or all of the following:

* [Create a project](https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/projects/manage/)
in Open Humans that requests access to a data source you're interested in
analyzing. (In Slack, you can ask if anyone will join and share
their data with you!)
* [Follow this guide](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/wiki/Downloading-data-shared-with-your-project) to retrieve the data shared with you.
* Share "rough draft" code that produces a simple analysis of this data

### Writing a stand-alone project admin backend
*Open Humans* is a modular eco system in which users can start their own projects
that can request data from users or put new data into the accounts of users.
These interactions are done largely through APIs. But for many basic administrative
works a graphical user interface would be good to have. Such a GUI
should be a stand-alone Django application that interfaces with the existing
Open Humans API methods. You can find
[more details in a corresponding GitHub issue](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/issues/690).

This project requires rudimentary skills in web application design and ideally some familiarity with Django/Python.
Students will learn how to interface with APIs and how build modular web applications. This project can be mentored by [Mike](https://github.com/mcescalante)
[Mad](https://github.com/madprime) and/or [Bastian](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke).

#### Contributing

Outreachy requires applicants to demonstrate skill and interest by making
one or more contributions to the project they're interested in.

To do so for this project, we ask you to try setting up and contributing to this
bare-bones starting point for a project admin backend: [https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-proj-management](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-proj-management)

### Extending the Python module for the Open Humans API
Many projects interact with Open Humans through our APIs (e.g. uploading/downloading/deleting data and sending messages). Many of these projects (including our own) are written in Python. We already have a basic Python library that enables the partial use of the full Open Humans API but it still lacks some of the API features that we want to see added.

In addition the extended library should then also be used to create a re-usable `Django` web application that can easily be plugged in into larger Django web apps to make interfacing with Open Humans easier.

Ultimately both the Python API client and the reusable web app should be published as `pip`-installable modules (with the `Django` app building on top of the general API library).


In short, the goals of these project are:

- Extending the Python library to include all the Open Humans API methods
- Using the extended Python API library to write a re-usable `Django` application
- Releasing both as `pip`-installable modules

You can find
[the already existing API client on GitHub along with issues ](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans-api/issues).

This project requires basic skills in Python to extend the API client library. In addition some web application experience with Django/Python is required.
Students will learn how to build a Python library that can be used to connect with APIs and how build a reusable web application. This project can be mentored by [Mad](https://github.com/madprime) and/or [Bastian](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke).

[Documentation about the Open Humans OAuth2 API can be found on our website](https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/oauth2-features/). Additionally, we have [Wiki page that lists our API endpoints](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/wiki/API-endpoints).

#### Contributing

Outreachy requires applicants to demonstrate skill and interest by making
one or more contributions to the project they're interested in.

To do so for this project, we ask you to try contributing to [some of the issues which are already on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans-api/issues).
