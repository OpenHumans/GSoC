  <p>
    Outreachy is an internship program for open-source projects, for
    groups traditionally underrepresented in tech. You can read more about

  <h2>Outreachy Summer 2018</h2>

  <p>
    The Outreachy Summer 2018 season is ON! Open Humans is accepted as an
    Outreachy community and seeks to support three internships.
    Interested mentors and prospective interns should
    <a href="http://slackin.openhumans.org">join #outreachy on our Slack</a>.
    Please announce yourself, so we know who you are! The details of each of our
    project ideas are listed below, including potential mentors.

      <b>Application deadline: March 22.</b><br>
      Because Outreachy applications involve making small contributions to
      demonstrate your abilities, it is <i>strongly</i> recommended you start
      applying several weeks before this deadline!

  <h3>Why apply?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most important features of the program is that interns are paired
    with mentors, who are typically experienced developers from Open Humans.
    The mentor guides the interns to work
    productively within the community, and helps the interns avoid obstacles and
    pitfalls. The program is global - interns and mentors may be located anywhere
    where they have an internet connection (except for countries affected by US
    trade restrictions), and no travel is required. Thus, aside from the stipend
    and mentorship aspects, the interns's experience in the internship closely
    mirrors normal work on distributed development projects. Effective work habits
    for distributed development are typically not taught as part of computer
    science curricula, yet are highly desired in the increasingly global and
    distributed software, IT, and biotechnology industries.
  </p>

  <p>
     From the viewpoint of Open Humans, the program not only offers to
     pay interns for contributing, but more importantly, offers an opportunity to
     recruit new developers who will hopefully go on to become regular, sustaining
     contributors.

  <h2>Intern Progress Reports</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to writing code, accepted interns participate in the virtual, weekly all-hands
      community meeting to report on their project's progress. These updates allow us to keep aware of
      how Outreachy interns are doing, give interns a forum to ask any questions, and
      promote overall community bonding.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to these meetings interns will also have fortnightly virtual meetings with
      their mentors to discuss progress, problems and strategies for the next weeks. interns are
      expected to write a progress report for these meetings. These reports should include:
    </p>

    <p>
      What did you do in the last two weeks? What do you plan to
      do in the next two weeks? Do you have any unanswered questions, any unsolved problems from
      the last weeks, interesting observations or anything else you'd like to mention?
    </p>
