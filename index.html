  <h1 class="page-heading">Google Summer of Code</h1>

  <p>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a student internship program for
     open-source projects. The program offers eligible student developers stipends
     to write code for open source projects over a period of 3 summer months ("flip
     bits, not burgers"). See the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code Main Site</a> for general
     information about the Google Summer of Code program, how to apply, frequently
     asked general questions, and more.

  <h2>GSoC 2018</h2>

  <p>
    The Google Summer of Code 2018 is ON! Open Humans is applying as a GSoC
    mentoring organization this year. Interested mentors and students should
    subscribe to the OBF/GSoC mailing list. Please announce yourself, so we know
    who you are! The details of each of our project ideas are listed below,
    including potential mentors.

          There is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss">Google group for posting GSoC questions</a>
          (and receiving answers; note that you will need to sign up for the group) that

          Students receive a stipend from Google if accepted. See the <a

          full documentation.

      <li>
          Development is done entirely remotely and on-line; there is no requirement or
          expectation for either students or mentors to travel.

  <h3>Why apply?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most important features of the program is that students are paired
    with mentors, who are typically experienced developers from Open Humans.
    The mentor guides the student to work
    productively within the community, and helps the student avoid obstacles and
    pitfalls. The program is global - students and mentors may be located anywhere
    where they have an internet connection (except for countries affected by US
    trade restrictions), and no travel is required. Thus, aside from the stipend
    and mentorship aspects, the student's experience in the internship closely
    mirrors normal work on distributed development projects. Effective work habits
    for distributed development are typically not taught as part of computer
    science curricula, yet are highly desired in the increasingly global and
    distributed software, IT, and biotechnology industries.
  </p>

  <p>
     From the viewpoint of Open Humans, the program not only offers to
     pay students for contributing, but more importantly, offers an opportunity to
     recruit new developers who will hopefully go on to become regular, sustaining
     contributors.

  <h2>Project ideas</h2>
    <p>Our GSoC ideas from each project are collected here:
       <a href="ideas/">Open Humans Project Ideas for GSoC 2018</a></p>

  <h2>Student Progress Reports</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to writing code, accepted students participate in the virtual, weekly all-hands
      community meeting to report on their project's progress. These updates allow us to keep aware of
      how GSoC students are doing, give students a forum to ask any questions, and
      promote overall community bonding.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to these meetings students will also have fortnightly virtual meetings with
      their mentors to discuss progress, problems and strategies for the next weeks. Students are
      expected to write a progress report for these meetings. These reports should include:
    </p>

    <p>
      What did you do in the last two weeks? What do you plan to
      do in the next two weeks? Do you have any unanswered questions, any unsolved problems from
      the last weeks, interesting observations or anything else you'd like to mention?
    </p>
